# langutil by desgroup
The need for a good parser is obvious in any language project.
This parser has its roots a few years ago when I begun making languages.
However, as time has gone by I have found that this parser (and some other classes) were a constant in almost any project I worked on.

As time went on, these components were iterated on and streamlined.
Eventually, there were so many different versions of these classes that it tough keeping track of which one was the latest.
I have decided to streamline and generalize the components and upload them here, for safe keeping.

You can add these classes with cmake using `add_subdirectory(langutil)`, like usual.
